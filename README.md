# diceroller.js

Javascript library for rolling dice. Supports strings written in a dice-rolling syntax, eg. "d12", "1d20", "4d6", "1d8+1".

## Usage

Include the `diceroller.js` file and use the `diceroller` object to roll dice.

```javascript
diceroller.roll(20); // roll a 20-sided die
diceroller.roll('4d6'); // roll four 6-sided dice
diceroller.roll('2d8+1'); // roll two 8-sided dice and add 1 to the result
```

You can get the result as an array of values rather than a single result if you set the verbose parameter to `true`.

```javascript
diceroller.roll(20, true); // result: [16]
diceroller.roll('4d6', true); // result: [1, 2, 4, 4]
diceroller.roll('2d8+1'); // result: [4, 6, 1]
```

The dice roller will roll a 6-sided die if no dice is specified and defaults to having verbose output off, but this can be modified by setting the appropriate variables.

```javascript
diceroller.defaultDie = 20; // will roll a 20-sided die if no parameter is passed to roll()
diceroller.verboseOutput = true; // will always return an array of results unless false is passed as the second parameter
```
